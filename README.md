Traffic Light FSM Simulator
This repository contains a simple implementation of a synchronous finite state machine (FSM) in C, simulating a traffic light system. The FSM transitions between three states—Green, Yellow, and Red—based on a simulated timer, demonstrating the principles of synchronous state machines in a Moore Machine configuration.

Overview
A synchronous finite state machine is a computational model where state transitions occur in sync with a clock signal. This project implements a traffic light controller as a Moore Machine, where outputs (light states) depend solely on the current state. The simulation uses a loop to mimic clock cycles and a counter to simulate timer expiration.
Features
Three states: Green, Yellow, Red.
Simulated timer to trigger state transitions.
Clear separation of state transition logic and output generation.
Written in C with a modular design for easy extension.
Requirements
A C compiler (e.g., GCC).
Git (optional, for cloning the repository).
A terminal or IDE (e.g., VS Code) to compile and run the code.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/traffic-light-fsm.git
cd traffic-light-fsm
Replace your-username with your GitHub username.
Compile the Code:
Using GCC:
bash
gcc -o traffic_light main.c
Usage
Run the Program:
bash
./traffic_light
This will simulate 15 clock cycles of the traffic light system.
Modify the Code (Optional):
Adjust cycles_per_state in main.c to change how long each state lasts.
Extend the FSM by adding new states or inputs in the next_state_function.
Code Structure
main.c:
State enum: Defines the FSM states (Green, Yellow, Red).
output_function: Handles outputs based on the current state.
next_state_function: Determines the next state based on the timer input.
main: Simulates clock cycles and drives the FSM.
